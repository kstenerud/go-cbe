Concise Binary Encoding
=======================

A go implementation of [concise binary encoding](https://github.com/kstenerud/concise-encoding/blob/master/cbe-specification.md).

Concise Binary Encoding is a general purpose, machine-readable, compact representation of semi-structured hierarchical data.


Goals
-----

  * General purpose encoding for a large number of applications
  * Supports the most common data types
  * Supports hierarchical data structuring
  * Binary format to minimize parsing costs
  * Little endian byte ordering to allow the most common systems to read directly off the wire
  * Balanced space and computation efficiency
  * Minimal complexity
  * Type compatible with [Concise Text Encoding (CTE)](cte-specification.md)



Library Usage
-------------

```golang
```

Output:

```
```

Note: This code is still work-in-progress!
